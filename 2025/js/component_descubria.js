        Descubria was an interactive children's park where young minds could step into the shoes of grown-ups and explore the world of work through play. In a vibrant, mini-city environment, kids took on roles like chefs, firefighters, builders, and healthcare workersâ€”earning play money for their efforts and discovering new passions along the way. Through hands-on experiences and realistic job simulations, Descubria offered a fun and educational glimpse into adult life, inspiring curiosity, responsibility, and imagination.
