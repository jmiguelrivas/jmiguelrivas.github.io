# apap

hello everyone, this is an application that was created when I was working at capital around 2015,

I was in charge of building the frontend using jquery, jade and sass with the beautiful design and illustrations provided by shirley tiscona

the application was meant to be a facebook app but this one is a recreation that i built using vue 2, and its currently part of the matryoshka portfolio, which is the concept that I choosed for my portfolio in 2022. its called matryoshka as the russian dolls because it contains all the other portfolios from previous years inside.

the application is meant to create a background image to be use in your computer with your family stylized as the miners from apap

in this part, the application will be collecting some data from the user before it can interact with the creation process

then you can start building your family, in this case I'm gonna be adding a pet

now I can choose between the 3 different kinds that are available

now Im gonna be adding a mom

now im gonna be adding a dad

now im gonna add a child

and now im going to select a background and finalize the process

in the real app the image was displayed here but in this demo app you are only gonna be able to see a family placeholder

and thats it
